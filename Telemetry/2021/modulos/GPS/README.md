# GPS on ESP32

## Description

Sometimes you just need to easily use a GPS, and your hardware serials are being used,
And sometimes you just want to add GPS functionality to your project.

I used EspSoftwareSerial and TinyGPS+, you can check it on links below. I already added them on /lib directory to make it easier to work.

This project is to help anyone on these matters. Feel free to use it as you want.
